Description

This repository contains the source code and related files for my semestral project in the Object-Oriented Programming course. The project is a game developed using C# called "Super Mario". It is a classic platformer game where players control the iconic character Mario as he navigates through various levels, defeats enemies, and collects power-ups .The game features colorful graphics, engaging gameplay mechanics, and nostalgic elements that pay homage to the original Super Mario games developed by Nintendo.
